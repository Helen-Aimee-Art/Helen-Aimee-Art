        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
            If you are interested in a commission, please email me with the information below.
            The number of projects I take on will vary, I will email you with confirmation if I am available to take on the project.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contact email address for updates and for the invoices</li>
            <li>Your name and the name of your character(s)</li>
            <li>Commission type</li>
            <li>Physical description of your character(s), including race, age etc. (any reference pictures are appreciated)</li>
            <li>Character(s) personality</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Once we have agreed the outline, I will send you a rough sketch for approval. If you are happy with the sketch I will send a Paypal invoice for 100% of the total fee to your email.
            Once the invoice has been paid I will continue working on your project; I will send updates throughout the process where you can ask for minor changes.
            Once completed, I will send a low resolution JPEG of the final piece and then, if you are happy, I will send the high resolution JPEG.
            If you are a new customer I will ask for 50% of the fee to be paid before I start working on the sketch and the rest to be paid after the sketch has been approved.
        </p>
        <h2>Monthly Themes</h2>
        <p>I will be running monthly themes which may mean that your commission will receive a discount. If you sign up for a commission with a character which is related to the theme in some way you will receive a 10% discount. 
           <br/>(Please note: This applies even if your commission is added to the wait list and not started right away, as long as you request the commission in the correct themed month the discount will be counted.)</p>
